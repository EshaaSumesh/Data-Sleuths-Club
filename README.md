**A data analytics mystery challenge for participants**

This repository contains a scenario-based activity where participants investigate a corporate data breach using structured datasets. The task is to identify which employee leaked a confidential AI model by analyzing login records, file access logs, audit trails, and competitor events.

## Objective

Use logical reasoning and data analysis to uncover:
**Who accessed and exfiltrated the AI model file?**

Participants will work with multiple datasets to detect patterns, rule out false leads, and arrive at a data-backed conclusion.
